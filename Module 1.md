# Module 1: Introduction to AWS
A client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

## Cloud computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. The undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT are all complex IT activities that don't separate you from your competition, such as installing a MySQL server.

**Burst capacity:** Use when on premise infrastructure takes heavy loads on certain times.

### Deployment models for cloud computing
1. Cloud-based: Runs all parts of the app in the cloud.
1. On-premises: Also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
1. Hybrid: Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.

### Benefits of cloud computing
1. Trade upfront expense for variable expense: Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing in resources you may not need.
1. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
1. Stop guessing capacity: Instead of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.
1. Benefit from massive economies of scale
1. Increase speed and agility: The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.
1. Go global in minutes: The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.

### Concepts in cloud computing
**Resiliency:** refers to the ability of a solution to absorb the impact of a problem in one or more parts of a system, while continuing to provide an acceptable service level to the business.

**Elasticity:** Ability to scale resources.

**Flexibility:** Ability to use a broad range of products.

**Agility:** Ability to release products faster.
