# Module 10: Cloud journey
## The AWS Well-Architected Framework
It helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement. It is based on five pillars: 
1. **Operational excellence:** The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. They include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.
1. **Security:** The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. They include implementing a strong identity foundation, enable traceability, apply security at all layers, automate security best practices, protect data in transit and at rest, keep people away from data, prepare for security events.
1. **Reliability:** Mainly to recover from failures. The ability of a system to:
    1. Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
    1. Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
    1. Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
1. **Performance efficiency:** The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements
1. **Cost optimization:** the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. To manage users:
    1. Use of AWS Organizations with respective OUs that differentiate billing across the company’s functions.
    1. Implement the most stringent security measures on the VPC-edge rather than on the resource hosts.

## Advantages of cloud computing
1. Trade upfront expense for variable expense: Instead of investing heavily, you can pay only when you consume.
1. Benefit from massive economies of scale: Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers, providers can achieve higher economies of scale.
1. Stop guessing capacity: You don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need
1. Increase speed and agility: The flexibility makes it easier to develop and deploy applications.
1. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
1. Go global in minutes
