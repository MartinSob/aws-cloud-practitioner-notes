# Module 7: Monitoring and Analytics
## Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics (CPU, RAM) and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics. CloudWatch uses metrics to represent the data points for your resources in graphs.

### CloudWatch alarms
With CloudWatch, you can create alarms that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold.

### CloudWatch dashboard
The CloudWatch dashboard feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location.

## AWS CloudTrail
Records API calls for your account (and from other accounts). The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more. Events are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call.

**CloudTrail Insights:** This optional feature allows CloudTrail to automatically detect unusual API activities in your AWS account.

## AWS Trusted Advisor
A web service that inspects your AWS environment and provides real-time recommendations in accordance with AWS best practices. The inspection includes security checks, such as Amazon S3 buckets with open access permissions.

Trusted Advisor compares its findings to AWS best practices in five categories: **cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits**. For the checks in each category, Trusted Advisor offers a list of recommended actions and additional resources to learn more about AWS best practices.

**AWS Trusted Advisor Notification** is an optional service that needs to be set up from the dashboard.

### AWS Trusted Advisor dashboard
Where you can review completed checks for cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. For each category:
- Green ðŸ¡ª no problems
- Orange ðŸ¡ª recommended investigations
- Red ðŸ¡ª recommended actions.

**Penetration testing** can be performed by customers, provided they work with the list of services mentioned by AWS.
